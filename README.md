Welcome to the Next.js TypeScript Testing Kit with Chakra UI! This starter kit provides a solid foundation for building Next.js applications with TypeScript, Chakra UI, and testing libraries. It includes everything you need to get started with building modern, responsive web applications that are easy to maintain and test.

The starter kit comes pre-configured with the following technologies:

- Next.js: a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications with performance optimizations out of the box.
- TypeScript: a statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early in the development process.
- Chakra UI: a modular and accessible component library that makes it easy to build beautiful and responsive UIs.
- Testing libraries: Jest and React Testing Library are included for writing unit and integration tests.

This starter kit is designed to help you quickly scaffold a new project and get up and running with minimal setup. Whether you're building a simple static website or a complex application, this starter kit provides a solid foundation for your project.

## üé¨ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### üß≥ Prerequisites

To get this project running locally you will need:

- a node package manager (yarn, npm or pnpm)
- a command line terminal (iTerm or bash)
- your favorite IDE (vscode, sublime)

### üíª Installing

Clone the repo, don't forget to change the name of the project:

```bash
npx create-next-app <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> -e https://github.com/RickBr0wn/next-typescript-testing-kit-with-chakra-ui
```

> Important note: You will need to install the dependencies manually, by using the command `npm install` in the root of the project.

Once the project and dependencies are finished installing, you can navigate to the root directory and start up the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Please credit this starter if you build something fantastic!

## üß™ Running the tests

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run all of the test suites with Jest and React Testing Library, in watch mode.
